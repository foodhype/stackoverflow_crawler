do while loop not working? Java - Stack Overflow
<\h1>
<p>I trying to make a do while loop that will keep looping till x either equals y or x equals 7
Here's the code:</p>
<pre><code>else if(y == 4 || y == 5 || y == 6 || y == 8 || y == 9 || y == 10){
    System.out.println("Value point is: " + y);

    int x = rollDice();
    do{
        System.out.println("Roll again: " + rollDice());
        x = rollDice();
    }
    while(x != y || rollDice() != 7);

    if(x == y){
        System.out.println("You Win!");
    }
    if(x == 7){
        System.out.println("You Lose");
    }
    return;

}}
</code></pre>
<p>This is what an output looks like from it: </p>
<pre><code>Dice roll is: 9
Value point is: 9
Roll again: 2
Roll again: 6
Roll again: 6
Roll again: 4
Roll again: 7
Roll again: 11
Roll again: 8
Roll again: 9
Roll again: 2
Roll again: 5
Roll again: 6
Roll again: 8
Roll again: 5
Roll again: 11
Roll again: 5
Roll again: 2
Roll again: 9
Roll again: 6
Roll again: 3
Roll again: 8
Roll again: 8
Roll again: 8
Roll again: 4
Roll again: 7
Roll again: 10
Roll again: 6
Roll again: 5
Roll again: 9
Roll again: 4
Roll again: 7
Roll again: 4
Roll again: 2
Roll again: 8
Roll again: 8
You Win!

<p>Obviously 8 does not equal 9, and since there was a seven near the beginning it should have said "you lose" I just don't where I'm going wrong on this? </p>
<p><em>EDIT:</em></p>
<p>Please change the loop to this:</p>
<pre><code>do{
    x = rollDice();
    System.out.println("Roll again: " + x);
}
while(x != y &amp;&amp; x != 7);
</code></pre>
<p>You should only call rollDice() once per iteration. You were calling it 3 times each go-round. Also, the || needed to be changed to &amp;&amp;.</p>
