java - Having some trouble with File I/O - Stack Overflow
<\h1>
<p>I have a homework assignment to read data from a file which contains names and scores per game of basketball players. The program is supposed to output the names and scores of the players, as well as tally each player's average score per game, and finally display the player with the highest average. I am currently stuck on trying to get the average and a newline character for each player. </p>
<p>Here is a pic of the input file I am reading the data from (apparently I can't actually post it as an image unless I have 10 rep, sorry):</p>

<p>and here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>import java.util.Scanner;
import java.io.File;

public class BasketballTeam

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException

        File f = new File("BasketballData.txt");

        if (f.exists())
        {
            Scanner input = new Scanner(f);
            int games = 0;
            int totalScore = 0;
            double avg = 0.0;

            while (input.hasNext())
            {
                String s = input.next();
                System.out.printf("%-9s", s);
                int a = input.nextInt();
                while (input.hasNextInt())
                {
                    if (a == -1)
                    {
                        avg = (double)totalScore/games;
                        System.out.printf("%14s%.2f\n", "Average of ", avg);
                        games = 0;
                        totalScore = 0;
                        s = input.next();
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        System.out.printf("%5s", a);
                        games++;
                        totalScore = totalScore + a;
                        a = input.nextInt();
                    }
                }                       
            }
        }
    }
}

<p>When I run the program, my output is just a single line that looks like:</p>
<pre><code>Smith       13   19    8   12Badgley      5Burch       15   18   16Watson......and so on
</code></pre>
<p>Why am I not getting any newline characters or my average? I want my output to look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Smith       13   19    8   12   Average of 13
Badgley      5   Average of 5
Burch       15   18   16   Average of 16.33
.....and so on

<p>Thanks in advanced for any suggestions/corrections.</p>

<p>This is what you are looking for.  You don't even need the -1 at the end of each line in the file you can get rid of that if you want unless it is part of the specification.  It will work without the -1.  Your inner loop you just want to add up your totals then outside of the inner loop get your average and display.  Then reset your variables.  You were pretty close just needed to change a couple things.  If you have any questions on how this works just ask away.  Hope this helps!</p>
