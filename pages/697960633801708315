loops - Why is my Java for/if/else statement outputting duplicates - Stack Overflow
<\h1>
<p>I am practicing using loops in Java and I have created this if/else loop to continually ask if there is another customer, if the user input is </p>
<ul>
<li><code>"Yes"</code> then it asks for that customers bill.</li>
<li><code>"No"</code> then I am going to total the bill (I haven't written code for that yet so ignore that part).</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem I am having is after I enter the initial bill amount the code asks if there is another customer like it should, but then prematurely asks for their bill amount and then asks if there is another customer a second time?
-My main question is, did I structure this wrong? How am I able to get the loop to not output something twice and/or prematurely?</p>
<pre><code>Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
double total;

System.out.println("Please enter your bill amount.");
double bill0 = input.nextDouble();

for(int c = 0; c &gt; -1; c++) {
    System.out.println("Is there another customer?");
    String customer = input.nextLine();

    if (customer.equalsIgnoreCase("Yes")) {
        System.out.println("Please enter their bill.");
        double bill = input.nextDouble();
    } else {
        System.out.println("Okay, let's total your bill amount.");
    }
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>for(int c = 0; c &gt; -1; c++) 
</code></pre>
<p>This loop will (basically) run forever as c will always be greater than -1.
(Actually this loop will run until overflow occurs because the value of c will be too big to fit in the available storage space allocated for this integer. You can refer here for more information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow</a>)</p>
<p>A cleaner way to structure this would be to do something like:</p>
<pre><code>String answer = "Yes";
while (answer.equals("Yes"))
{
    System.out.println("Please enter your bill amount.");
    double bill0 = input.nextDouble();

    System.out.println("Is there another customer? (Yes or No)");
    answer = input.nextLine();    
}  
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, you need to add error handling if the user enters inputs that you are not expecting. Also, this is more pseudocode than a true implementation.</p>
<p>After this while loop is when you would want to total the amount. Also, in the while loop you might want to have a variable keeping the total amount. Something like:</p>
<pre><code>total += bill0; 
</code></pre>
<p>after the line: </p>
<pre><code>double bill0 = input.nextDouble(); 
</code></pre>
<p>might do the trick.</p>
