Final keyword in java allowing changes in a method - Stack Overflow
<\h1>
<p>I was playing around with some java to get a better feel for scopes. I wrote the following piece of code:</p>
<pre><code>public class Scope {

    static int [] arr = { 10 };
    static final int num = 5;

    public static void manipulate(int[] arr, int num) {
        num = arr[0] + 10;
        arr[0] = num;
    }

    public static void main(String [] args) {
        manipulate(arr, num);
        System.out.println("arr[0] = "+ arr[0]);
        System.out.println("num = "+num);
    }  
}
</code></pre>
<p>Even though num is declared as static and final I am able to change its value inside the manipulate method. Just looking for some clarification on this as I did not think I would be able to change this.</p>
<p>You aren't changing the <code>static final</code> <code>num</code> variable; you are changing the local copy of it in <code>manipulate</code>'s <code>num</code> parameter local variable.  When you print <code>num</code> back in <code>main</code>, it will still be <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>You are manipulating the method argument, not the static field. The argument is <code>hiding</code> the static field.</p>
<p>You have two num defined in your code.
First one is, this one never changed</p>
<pre><code>   static final int num = 5;
</code></pre>
<p>Second one is: this second on is changed by your code</p>
<pre><code>   public static void manipulate(int[] arr, int num) 
</code></pre>
<p>You are passing first one into second num, by Java is pass by value, your first num is not changed by this passing.</p>
