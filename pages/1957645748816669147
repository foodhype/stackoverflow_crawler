java - Why is while loop not exiting when conditions = false - Stack Overflow
<\h1>
<p>I've got a loop running and when it reaches the the else statement it should stop running. When I debug the boolean power does update but it still enters the loop. I know I could use System.Exit(0); or a break;  but I would understand the logic behind why it would keep running with false conditions? </p>
<pre><code>public class Mmu {      
    //code omitted
    public static final Mmu MMU = new Mmu();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MMU.runProcesses();
        //code omitted
    }
        private Mmu() {
            //code omitted 
        }
    protected void runProcesses(){
        boolean power= false; // running processes,  normally this would start as false but I changed to test
        boolean twoFinished = false;
        boolean oneFinished = false;
        while (power = true) { //still entering this when power = false why
            twoFinished = MMU.processTwo.finished();
            oneFinished = MMU.processOne.finished();
            if (oneFinished = false) {
                MMU.processOne.thread();
            } else if (twoFinished = false) {
                MMU.processTwo.thread();
            } else {
                power = false;
                System.out.println("All processes Finished");
                //System.exit(0);
            }
        }   
    }
}

<p>Thanks for any advice in advance.</p>
<pre><code>while (power = true) 
</code></pre>
<p>Is <em>always</em> <code>true</code> since you're assigning and not comparing.</p>
<p>Write:</p>
<pre><code>while(power) 
</code></pre>
<p>instead.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The expression of the assignment returns the <strong>assigned</strong> value.</p>
<p>That's why we don't like to use <code>==</code> when we compare <code>boolean</code>s, it might lead to this kind of mistakes. You can simply write <code>if(someBoolean)</code> instead of <code>if(someBoolean == true)</code>.</p>
<p><code>while (power = true)</code>  here your are using assigning operator and assigning <code>power = true</code> again. Use <code>while(power)</code></p>
